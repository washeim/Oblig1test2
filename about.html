    <h2>About Project</h2>
    <p>To use different semantic tags i looked through the previous lectures and
      youtube videos to prepare. I decided to mainly use h1 and p for my headers
      and main content for my text. That is because I found it the simplest solution.
      I also decided to use ul and ol in my resume page for example. I used mainly
      unordered lists because it didnt really make sense to list them with numbers.
      To use an ordered list I did it for my language list because it was more fitting.
      I used the a href on every page to be able to return to the home page,
       so its easier to navigate back and forth. I used the div tag to create a menu and a content.
        where the menu was for the navigation between the different pages and content were for the main content of that website</p>
